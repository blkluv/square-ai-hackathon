# 
## 1)Layout Design:
* ## Our appilicaion creates a layout to the market with a focus on user experience , for example: giving better recommendations for layout based on the invoices received from the customer (i.e the optimal placement of products).

## 2)Accessibility Features:
* ## our application also enhances Square's accessibility by incorporating AI-driven features such as voice-guided navigation, for example: Customer gives his current location in voice as input and we'll show the shortest possible path for the customer to reach his desired product destination. 

## 3)Product Graph:
* ## Our application also provides a product graph which shows the relationship between the products based on the customer's purchase history, for example: if a customer buys a product A then he is more likely to buy product B, so we'll show the relationship between the products in the form of a graph. This is also useful for constructing layout design.

## 4)Customer Segmentation:
* ## Our application also provides customer segmentation based on the customer's purchase history and make customer groups. For example: if customer A buys product a, b and c and customer B buys product a, b and d then we'll group them together and show them as a group. 


# Use Cases 
* ## The Layout design allows the owner to have a better over view of the possible postions of products
* ## the second idea gives benefit for the customer to navigte faster for his desired product.
* ## Based on the current data present it gives special benifits/gift cards for the customers to gain attraction.
